This is a random short term todo list. Items written here are subject to discussion.
Feel free to ask on nemiver-list@gna.org about particular topics that you may be interested to take over.

* add a watchpoint setting dialog.
  See bug http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=386450 for description.

*  Close all open files when switching to a new debug session.
   See http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=381703 for description.

* Add Support for remote debugging.
  See http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=384418 for description.

*) write a gdb command interpreter widget (prolly based on Gtk::TextView),
   using IDebugger. It should accept commands with the
   same syntax as the classical gdb syntax and call IDebugger in the background.

*) Display a nice "where-marker" for the cases where the classical
   "where-marker" (the arrow) and the breakpoint marker (the red circle)
   are on the same line. Today, this is not precisely
   handled so it looks very ugly.

*) in the "load core file" workflow, grey out debugging actions that don't
   make sense like those related to stepping and breakpoint setting.

*) Add ability to show disassembly of the source
